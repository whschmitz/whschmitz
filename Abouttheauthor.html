	<h2>About the Author</h2>

	<p>My name is Will Schmitz and I am a junior studying economics at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. I have a great interest in current events, including politics, international relations, and government affairs. I aspire to educate and inform Wisconsinites about the candidates for this terms Supreme Court election! 

	Misinformation and disinformation are all too prevalent in today's media. My aim as the author of this site is to better inform the public about politics in a truthful, unbiased manner.
